Inspired by /tv/'s posting culture, this browser extension aims to facilitate the creation of mass replies on 4chan.org and 4channel.org, and also reply to dubs.

## Usage
Click on the toolbar icon when in a thread, and select one of four options.

- "Quote" quotes all the replies in the thread.
- "Sneed" adds "sneed" at the end.
- "Check 'em" only quotes post with repeating digits.
- "KnowYourMeme" quotes knowyourmeme.com filenames.
- "Copy To Clipboard" is self explanatory.

In addition, the extension highlights knowyourmeme filenames and can delete 4chan(nel) cookies by right clicking and selecting "Delete cookies" on a 4chan(nel) page.
